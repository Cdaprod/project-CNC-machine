## CdaProd/project-CNC-machine
This is the repository for a hardware project of mine. From zero hardware build of a CNC machine, including the circuitry and programming of the embedded firmware required. 

### Component List
- Bed size equivalent to “CNC 6040 3-axis“
- GRBL Board 1.1 (stepper motor driver)
- 1500w VFD Controller (spindle)
- 400Hz Spindle (water cooled) + Water Pump
- Handheld Pendant Controller (Offline)

### pendantController Folder
- Contains arduino sketches for addition of an "Offline-CNC-Controller" handheld pendant; to be implemented via Arduino Nano.
    
######This project is already complete (I am slowly adding details for the sake of documentation).
