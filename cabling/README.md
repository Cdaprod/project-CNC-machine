If the wire colors themselves do not change but only the pin assignments are reversed at the control box end, then you do not need an additional column for "Shielded Cable Wire Color (Reversed)" in your table. The colors of the wires remain consistent; it's just the pin numbers that change due to the reversed connector.

However, if you find it helps clarify the setup, especially during wiring or for documentation purposes, you could add a column to explicitly state the pin reversals. This could prevent any confusion during installation or maintenance. Here's how you might format the table if you choose to add this column for clarity:

### Expanded Wiring Table with Pin Reversals Noted:

| Motor End Pin | Motor Wire Color | Shielded Cable Wire Color | Control Box End Pin (Reversed) | Reversed Cable Wire Color |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| -             | -                | Shield Drain              | 5                             | Shield Drain             |
| 1             | Red              | Red                       | 4                             | Red                      |
| 2             | Green            | White                     | 3                             | White                    |
| 3             | Blue             | Black                     | 2                             | Black                    |
| 4             | Yellow           | Yellow/Green              | 1                             | Yellow/Green             |

This table includes a column for "Reversed Cable Wire Color" which essentially mirrors the "Shielded Cable Wire Color" since the color assignments do not change. This column emphasizes that the physical connection must consider the reversal at the control box, ensuring that each wire connects to the correct pin despite the reversed pin configuration.

For effective documentation and easy reference during installation or troubleshooting, it's beneficial to have separate tables for your aviator connectors and snap connectors. This will help clarify the connections at each end of your cables, especially since they serve different functions and might have unique pin configurations.

Hereâ€™s how you can structure these tables to maintain clarity and order:

### 1. Table for Aviator Connectors
This table will detail the wiring from the shielded cable to the aviator connectors, which typically interface with the control box. The rows should follow the logical flow of signals from the motor to the control system.

**Aviator Connector Wiring Table:**

| Aviator Pin | Cable Wire Color | Function         | Control Box End Pin (Reversed) |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| 5           | Shield Drain     | Ground/Shielding | 1                              |
| 4           | Red              | Power (+)        | 2                              |
| 3           | White            | Data/Signal      | 3                              |
| 2           | Black            | Data/Signal      | 4                              |
| 1           | Yellow/Green     | Ground (-)       | 5                              |

### 2. Table for Snap Connectors
This table will map the wiring from the motor wires to the shielded cable via snap connectors, which are typically used at the motor end for a secure connection.

**Snap Connector Wiring Table:**

| Snap Connector Pin | Motor Wire Color | Shielded Cable Wire Color | Function   |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| 1                  | Red              | Red                       | Power (+)  |
| 2                  | Green            | White                     | Data/Signal|
| 3                  | Blue             | Black                     | Data/Signal|
| 4                  | Yellow           | Yellow/Green              | Ground (-) |
| -                  | -                | Shield Drain              | Ground/Shielding |

### Key Points to Consider:

- **Ordering**: Each table follows a logical order from power and data/signals to grounding/shielding. This helps in understanding the flow of connections.
- **Color Coding**: Consistent use of color coding helps in quick identification and minimizes errors during wiring.
- **Function Column**: Adding a 'Function' column provides context about what each wire is used for, which is crucial during diagnostics or modifications.
- **Reversal Notation**: For the aviator connectors, specifying the control box end pin (reversed) ensures clarity about how the reversal affects the pin assignments.

Having these tables allows anyone working on or maintaining the CNC machine to quickly understand how and where each wire should be connected. It also aids in ensuring consistency and correctness in wiring, especially when dealing with complex or custom configurations.
